#Prompt - Build a mini programming dictionary a user can search through and ad to using the ad to using the words.csv file:Access the words.csv file and store the data to a dictionary, where each word in the file is a key of the dictionary and the value stored to each key is the wordâ€™s corresponding definition. Then, create a repeatable program that allows a user to interact with the dictionary based on the following menu.

#Variable Dictionary:
#library - list holding the 'keys' and 'values'
#ans - 'y' is the response used to exit the while loop
#menu - list holding the menu options
#choice - the choice of user from the menu given
#search - the word user chooses to find
#found - #flag var, will be replaced with index position if name is found; we are using a -1 because it is not a valid index location
#word - user added word to the dictionary
#meaning - the meaning user inputs for the word they add
